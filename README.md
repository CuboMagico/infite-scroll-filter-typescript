# Roger Melo's infinite scroll and filter.

The project consists in a simple filter with 'infinite' load requests when the scroll hits de bottom of the page.
I also created this repository to learn how to make these functionalities, but more important is Typescript part.
Typescript have a sharp learn curvature, so i'm trying to learn with small projects. This time, e transcript a vanila Javascript project to Typescript, with a clean code an good practicies. This project have some minimal changes from the original one too.

To test, only need to clone and open `public/index.html`
